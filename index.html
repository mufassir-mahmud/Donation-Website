            <h2>About Our Donation</h2>
        <p>In other words, if you need help, our friendly customer support team will make sure you don't have to campaign alone.We started Donately in 2013, in partnership with creative agency Fifty & Fifty, after working with numerous nonprofits. Our experience showed us an alarming gap in the online donation software market, so we set out to create the simplest solution around.

            More than 1,000 nonprofits, organizations, and individuals trust Donately to manage their online donations. Built with simplicity in mind, our features give you more time to raise money online and our software grows with you, so the possibilities are endless.
            
            Ultimately, we believe time should be spend solving social challenges, not wasted using clunky and expensive online donation software.</p>
